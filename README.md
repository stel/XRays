# XRays

XRays is an educational level 3D modelling and rendering system for Windows created in early 2009. It doesn't use OpenGL or DirectX, just plain math.

XRays allows you to create and modify the three-dimensional polygonal objects in real time and perform a realistic rendering of the resulting scene.

Some algorithms used:

- Z-Buffer
- Progressive shading (optimized for fast filling of the triangles + z-buffer support)
- Bresenham's line (with z-buffer support)
- Backward Ray Tracing (with antialiasing support) 

## Any docs?
